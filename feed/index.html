										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain technology brought the concept of decentralization into the financial world, but it was Ethereum and its </span><b>smart contracts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that <a href="https://www.neucenttechnologies.com/how-is-blockchain-reshaping-the-landscape-of-modern-industries/">elevated the industry to entirely new levels</a>. By enabling programmable transactions, Ethereum became the foundation for </span><b>Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a rapidly evolving ecosystem that is reshaping traditional finance. Let’s explore the story of Ethereum, smart contracts, Solidity, and how they’ve taken DeFi to the next level.</span></p>
<h2><b><span id="Table1" class="scroll_div">Why Are They Called Smart Contracts?</span></b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term </span><b>“smart contract”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was coined by computer scientist </span><b>Nick Szabo</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the 1990s. These contracts automatically execute and enforce terms without the need for intermediaries. While they’re called “smart,” it’s essential to understand what makes them “smart” and whether the term truly applies.</span></p>
<h3><b>What Makes a Smart Contract &#8220;Smart&#8221;?</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Automation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Smart contracts self-execute when pre-defined conditions are met. For instance, a loan repayment triggers the release of collateral without any manual oversight.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>No Intermediaries</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Unlike traditional contracts requiring banks or lawyers, smart contracts reduce reliance on third parties by operating directly on a blockchain.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Immutable Rules</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Once deployed, their terms are fixed and cannot be altered, ensuring fairness and transparency.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Are Smart Contracts Really Smart?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While innovative, </span><b>smart contracts aren’t intelligent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the way artificial intelligence is. They are essentially pre-programmed scripts that execute specific instructions. Their &#8220;intelligence&#8221; lies in their efficiency and ability to eliminate manual processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Smart</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Because they automate processes and reduce human intervention.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Not Smart</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Because they cannot think, learn, or adapt beyond their pre-coded logic.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><b><span id="Table2" class="scroll_div">What is Solidity, and What is it Based On?</span></b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solidity is the </span><b>primary programming language</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used to create smart contracts on Ethereum. It was specifically designed to interact with the </span><b>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, enabling developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and programmable financial systems.</span></p>
<h3><b>Key Features of Solidity:</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>High-Level Language</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Solidity is easy to write and understand for developers, making it accessible for blockchain development.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Object-Oriented</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Solidity leverages object-oriented principles to simplify code management and create reusable components.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Statically Typed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Variables are explicitly defined, which helps catch errors during the development process.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Solidity’s Origins:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solidity borrows heavily from several popular programming languages:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>JavaScript</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Its syntax is intuitive for developers familiar with web programming.</span></li>
<li><b>C++</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Solidity inherits control structures and object-oriented principles.</span></li>
<li><b>Python</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The clean, readable syntax of Solidity reflects Python’s influence.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developed by Ethereum’s co-founder </span><b>Gavin Wood</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Solidity has become the backbone of Ethereum-based DeFi applications.</span></p>
<h2><b><span id="Table3" class="scroll_div">DeFi Revolution: Use Cases of Smart Contracts</span></b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart contracts have transformed Ethereum into the world’s largest </span><b>Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ecosystem. Unlike traditional finance that relies on centralized institutions like banks, DeFi operates through blockchain-based protocols powered by smart contracts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the most significant </span><b>DeFi use cases</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enabled by smart contracts:</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Lending and Borrowing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart contracts allow platforms like </span><b>Aave</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>Compound</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><b>MakerDAO</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to offer decentralized lending and borrowing services.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>For Lenders</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Users can deposit their crypto assets into liquidity pools and earn interest.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>For Borrowers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Users can borrow funds by locking up collateral. Smart contracts ensure automatic liquidation if the collateral value drops below a specified threshold.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This eliminates the need for credit checks or financial intermediaries, enabling global access to financial services.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>2. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platforms like </span><b>Uniswap</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>SushiSwap</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><b>Balancer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use smart contracts to facilitate peer-to-peer token trading without intermediaries.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart contracts calculate token prices using automated market makers (AMMs).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users trade directly from their wallets, ensuring privacy and security.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>3. Stablecoins and Algorithmic Tokens</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stablecoins like </span><b>DAI</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are managed through smart contracts, ensuring their value remains stable by adjusting supply and demand. This is crucial for creating a stable medium of exchange in volatile crypto markets.</span></p>
<h3><b>4. Yield Farming and Staking</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeFi platforms reward users for providing liquidity or staking their tokens. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users deposit funds into liquidity pools on Uniswap or Curve Finance.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart contracts calculate and distribute rewards automatically, ensuring transparency.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>5. Insurance and Risk Management</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeFi insurance platforms like </span><b>Nexus Mutual</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer decentralized coverage for risks such as smart contract exploits. Claims are assessed and paid out via smart contracts, removing traditional bottlenecks.</span></p>
<h2><b><span id="Table4" class="scroll_div">Challenges in Smart Contracts and DeFi</span></b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While DeFi and smart contracts offer enormous potential, they are not without challenges:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Bugs and Vulnerabilities</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Poorly written smart contracts can lead to exploits, like the infamous </span><b>DAO hack of 2016</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which caused millions in losses.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Gas Fees</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Executing smart contracts can become costly during network congestion, which has prompted competitors like Solana and Avalanche to rise.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Regulatory Risks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: DeFi’s decentralized nature often conflicts with regulatory frameworks, creating uncertainty for users and developers.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To overcome these challenges, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum">Ethereum</a> continues to innovate with </span><b>Ethereum 2.0</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which aims to improve scalability and reduce gas fees. Meanwhile, developers are adopting best practices and thorough audits to secure smart contracts.</span></p>
<h2><b><span id="Table5" class="scroll_div">The Road Ahead: Ethereum and Beyond</span></b></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrency, often referred to as &#8220;crypto,&#8221; is a revolutionary digital asset that operates on blockchain technology, offering a fundamentally new way of transferring value and enabling decentralized financial systems. To understand what problem it solves, let’s delve into the mechanics of traditional money transfers and compare them with blockchain-based systems.</span></p>
<h2><b><span id="Table1" class="scroll_div">Traditional Money Transfers: A Centralized Process</span></b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the conventional financial system, when you transfer money to someone, the money isn’t physically moved between banks or accounts. Instead, what happens is a series of </span><b>database entries</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your bank deducts the amount from your account balance.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recipient&#8217;s bank credits the same amount to their account.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This process relies on intermediaries, such as </span><b>banks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or systems like </span><b>SWIFT</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to facilitate the transaction and ensure its authenticity.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This setup has a major drawback: </span><b>centralized trust.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You rely entirely on the bank or centralized agency to verify, validate, and guarantee that the transaction is genuine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While banks are secure to some extent, they are not immune to issues like fraud, system failures, or corruption. Additionally, centralized systems are prone to delays, high fees, and restrictions.</span></p>
<h2><b><span id="Table2" class="scroll_div">Crypto and Blockchain: A Decentralized Solution</span></b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter cryptocurrency. Unlike traditional systems, crypto operates on </span><b>blockchain technology</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, eliminating the need for a centralized authority. Here&#8217;s how it works:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Actual Asset Transfer:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When you transfer <a href="https://crypto.com/">cryptocurrency</a>, the asset (e.g., Bitcoin) is moved from your wallet to the recipient&#8217;s wallet. This is not a database entry controlled by a central institution—it’s a </span><b>real, peer-to-peer transfer.</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Validation by Miners:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Transactions on a blockchain are verified and validated by </span><b>miners</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (or validators in some blockchains). These miners are independent individuals or entities who use computational power to ensure that the transaction is legitimate. This process, called </span><b>proof-of-work</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or other consensus mechanisms like </span><b>proof-of-stake</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, provides security and integrity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Decentralization and Security:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Unlike banks or SWIFT, there is no single point of failure. The blockchain network is decentralized, spreading across thousands (or millions) of computers globally. To hack or manipulate a transaction, a hacker would need to control over 50% of all the miners’ computers—a task that is </span><b>practically impossible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to the sheer scale and computational power required.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The innovation behind </span><b>blockchain development</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plays a critical role here. Programming languages like </span><b>Solidity and Rust </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">empower developers to build robust decentralized systems that validate and secure these transactions seamlessly.</span></p>
<h2><b><span id="Table3" class="scroll_div">The Breakthrough: Trustless Transactions</span></b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrency solves the fundamental problem of </span><b>trust in centralized institutions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by creating a </span><b>trustless system</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You no longer need to rely on banks, payment processors, or other intermediaries to ensure that your money transfer is genuine. Instead, the blockchain&#8217;s decentralized network and cryptographic protocols guarantee:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Transparency:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every transaction is recorded on a public ledger, accessible to anyone. This eliminates ambiguity and ensures accountability.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Security:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Blockchain’s cryptographic nature and decentralization make it virtually impossible to tamper with transactions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Speed and Cost Efficiency:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Crypto transactions often bypass intermediaries, resulting in lower fees and faster processing times, especially for international payments.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advancement of </span><b>blockchain development</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, combined with the flexibility of programming tools like </span><b>Solidity and</b> <b>Rust </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">for scalable systems, is driving this trustless ecosystem further.</span></p>
<h2><b><span id="Table4" class="scroll_div">Beyond Money Transfers: Solving Multiple Use Cases</span></b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The applications of cryptocurrency go beyond just transferring money. It addresses various challenges across industries:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cross-border payments:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Reduces fees and delays associated with international money transfers.</span></li>
<li><b>Financial inclusion:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Provides access to financial services for the unbanked population worldwide.</span></li>
<li><b>Smart contracts:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Enables programmable money and decentralized applications (dApps).</span></li>
<li><b>Tokenization:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Creates new markets for assets like real estate, art, and intellectual property.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it&#8217;s creating innovative decentralized applications or building secure financial systems, </span>blockchain development<span style="font-weight: 400;"> is becoming the backbone of modern decentralized economies.</span></p>

<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrency is more than just digital money; it represents a paradigm shift in how we transfer value, build trust, and interact with financial systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By decentralizing transactions and eliminating reliance on centralized entities, crypto offers a secure, transparent, and efficient alternative that solves some of the fundamental flaws of traditional systems.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These regulations improve trust and protect patient information from being accessed by unauthorized people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team needs to understand healthcare security rules and use the best methods to protect the app. Here are some important things they’ll do to make the app secure:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>SSL connections</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make sure patient data is safely sent over the internet.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encrypt sensitive data, like </span><b>Protected Health Information (PHI)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to keep it safe.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow rules like the </span><b>HITECH Act</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>GDPR</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ensure the app meets legal standards.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider using </span><b>HIPAA-compliant cloud platforms</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for safely storing and managing patient data.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Step 6- Payment Integrations</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your appointment booking app has an online payment feature, it will reduce the no-show issue. Because if the patient has made the payment, they will surely visit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you integrate the payment gateways into your app it will only help you succeed and deliver a strong user experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose the right payment provider that helps in transparent and secured transactions. Some popular payment providers for healthcare apps are </span><b>Stripe</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>PayPal</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><b>Braintree</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

This way, if you need to find a specialist, you can easily </span><b>filter</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>narrow down</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your options to find the right doctor in just a few seconds.</span></p>
<h3><b>Reminders and notifications </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the appointment booking app notifies upcoming bookings, patients would be less likely to miss their appointments. This feature helps everyone stay organized and avoid missing important things like appointments or payments.</span></p>
<h3><b>Geo-location based search</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature allows patients to find doctors or clinics nearby using their phone’s location. It is necessary to offer faster access to personalized healthcare, better convenience, and improved patient satisfaction. This feature improves the speed, accessibility, and efficiency of healthcare, benefiting both patients and providers.</span></p>
<h3><b>Doctor review</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature allows patients to review doctor and their services. These reviews are accessible to all patients to make the right choice in case of emergency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients can sort nearby doctors based on their ratings given by other patients. This feature builds trust, helps patients make informed decisions, and encourages doctors to continually improve their services.</span></p>
<h3><b>Stakeholder’s profile</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These features allow everyone to have their own profile on the app. Each profile contains important information and details relevant to their role. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding this feature improves communication, helps manage patient information, and makes the app more efficient by giving each user the right tools for their role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These features are basic to have in your appointment booking app. Here are some advanced features of Zocdoc that you must consider to integrate.</span></p>
<h2><span id="Table5" class="scroll_div">Advanced Features of Zocdoc</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53759" src="https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/4-1.jpg" alt="Advanced Zocdoc’s Features to Consider " width="1600" height="851" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#imagemodal" srcset="https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/4-1.jpg 1600w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/4-1-300x160.jpg 300w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/4-1-1024x545.jpg 1024w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/4-1-768x408.jpg 768w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/4-1-1536x817.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zocdoc uses technology to connect patients with the right doctors and reduce wait times, helping hospitals and clinics across the U.S. and helping patients in all 50 states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the technologies that give Zocdoc an advantage include special syncing tools, a search engine powered by patient preferences, artificial intelligence (AI), and a system that helps manage patient data efficiently. </span></p>
<h3><b>Proprietary sync technology</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It allows patients to see </span><b>real-time appointment availability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from doctors. It connects Zocdoc to the calendars of healthcare providers, even if they use different systems to manage appointments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This way, patients can quickly find open slots and book their visits without having to call the doctor’s office. It makes the whole booking process faster and more convenient for everyone.</span></p>
<h3><b>Patient-powered search</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>patient-powered search engine</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses </span><b>machine learning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help patients find the right doctor by letting them search using their own words—whether that’s common terms, slang, or even misspelled symptoms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes it easier for patients to describe what they&#8217;re feeling and still find the right provider. It also shows available appointment slots, so patients can quickly book an appointment.</span></p>
<h3><b>Artificial Intelligence</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zocdoc’s app uses </span><b>AI</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help patients check if their </span><b>insurance</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will cover their doctor’s visit. The AI can read and understand information from </span><b>thousands of insurance cards</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, match them with the right insurance provider, and make sure everything is verified. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps remove the confusion and delays that can come with using insurance, making it easier for people to access healthcare.</span></p>
<h3><b>Online active search ingestion algorithm</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zocdoc uses a system called </span><b>OASIS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to instantly update a doctor’s information whenever it changes. For example, if a doctor changes their schedule or contact details, the system makes these updates in </span><b>real time</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without slowing down the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OASIS works by using special tools (called AWS Lambda and SQS) to automatically trigger updates when new information comes in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means the app always has the most up-to-date information about doctors, providing a smooth and fast experience for both patients and doctors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such features may lift your budget but help you make a significant impact in the growing healthcare industry. But, how much does it cost to build a doctor-on-demand app like Zocdoc? Let’s explore.</span></p>
<h2><span id="Table6" class="scroll_div">Doctor Booking Appointment App Development Cost [Overview]</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing an appointment booking app like Zocdoc requires time and investment. Here is a quick timeline overview with costs. </span></p>

<h2><span id="Table1" class="scroll_div">CRM Platform- Overview</span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A platform that helps businesses track, manage, and engage existing as well as potential customers. It helps businesses automate workflows and operations like sales calls, customer service chats, or marketing emails to stay in every loop without missing any crucial leads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the introduction of AI in CRM, the landscape has completely changed, as AI does all the hardwork and brainwork for you, reducing manual efforts and errors. Results? </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From small-scale companies to large enterprises, CRM can help improve productivity. </span><a href="https://www.dataaxleusa.com/blog/customer-relationship-management-statistics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">74% of businesses in the United States</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have implemented a CRM system to manage their customer interactions effectively.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-53780 size-full" src="https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/CRM-Platform.jpg" alt="CRM Platform" width="1200" height="524" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#imagemodal" srcset="https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/CRM-Platform.jpg 1200w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/CRM-Platform-300x131.jpg 300w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/CRM-Platform-1024x447.jpg 1024w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/CRM-Platform-768x335.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the rising demand for CRM across industries and departments, businesses seek AI-powered CRM platforms for better results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is estimated that </span><a href="https://www.dataaxleusa.com/blog/customer-relationship-management-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">75% of organizations </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">using CRM software have seen a significant improvement in customer satisfaction metrics.</span></p>
<h2><span id="Table2" class="scroll_div">How Does a CRM Platform Benefit Your Business in 2025?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a business today is complicated because companies use lots of different tools — almost 1,000 different apps, in fact! But, only about 28% of these tools work together smoothly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To succeed, your company needs to focus on customers and use the right technology. But ensuring accurate and real-time information across departments like sales, customer service, marketing, and social media is tricky. This is why businesses need a </span><b>CRM </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s why it’s important.</span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Single source of truth (Customer Satisfaction)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It means having all your customer information in one place. </span><a href="https://www.digitalgyd.com/crm-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50% of organizations </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">use CRM data for creating accurate and up-to-date forecasts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, with CRM software, you can see a complete customer profile — a clear, easy-to-read dashboard with their past purchases, current orders, and any customer service issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps you serve them better because </span><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/in/resources/research-reports/state-of-the-connected-customer/?d=pb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">70% of customers expect </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">every company representative to know their history when they contact you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how the customer reaches out (phone, chat, email, or social media), having all the information in one place makes it easier for everyone in your company to provide the best service.</span></p>
<h3><strong>2. Improved Sales </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With CRM platforms, sales teams can automate workflows and close more deals. The sales team will have a clear view of each customer, including their past purchases, their queries in the past, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps them personalize their approach and increase their chances of making a sale. It helps businesses understand better what their customer wants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRM helps-</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>70% of sales reps say CRM helps them close more deals</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boost lead conversions by </span><b>300%</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saves time with automated workflow. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leads to </span><b>shorter sales cycles</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>3. Increased Team Collaboration</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CRM helps all your teams work together by sharing important customer information. For example, marketers can use it to run campaigns and understand customer behavior. It shows the journey of a customer, from their first inquiry to a sale. </span></p>
<p>The sales team can then use that information to offer personalized deals on your website. If a customer needs help, the customer service team can see their past interactions and provide better support. This makes everyone’s job easier and helps create a smoother experience for the customer.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Better Lead Conversion</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CRM helps businesses convert leads into customers more effectively. It tracks all information about potential customers (leads), including their requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows sales teams to follow up at the right time with the right information, making it easier to solve their queries faster. The CRM helps-</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prioritize leads</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automate follow-ups</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide personalized communication, </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">improving the chances of closing the sale.</span></p>
<h3><strong>5. AI automation for increased productivity</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining CRM with AI (artificial intelligence) can boost productivity. AI helps gather all the information about a customer — even things you might not know yet — and uses it to make every interaction more personalized. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means your team can work smarter and faster. For example, AI can quickly handle tasks like writing sales emails, creating marketing messages, or updating product descriptions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can also help predict things like sales targets or the best time to send marketing emails. This makes your employees more efficient and helps your business make better decisions.</span></p>
<h2><span id="Table3" class="scroll_div">How CRM Software Helps Different Teams?</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-53781 size-full" src="https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/How-CRM-Software-Helps-Different-Teams.jpg" alt="CRM Software Helps Different Teams" width="1200" height="394" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#imagemodal" srcset="https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/How-CRM-Software-Helps-Different-Teams.jpg 1200w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/How-CRM-Software-Helps-Different-Teams-300x99.jpg 300w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/How-CRM-Software-Helps-Different-Teams-1024x336.jpg 1024w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/How-CRM-Software-Helps-Different-Teams-768x252.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<h3><strong>1. Customer Support</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><b>customer support CRM</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps your managers work more efficiently by keeping all customer questions and requests in one place. This makes it easier and faster to solve customer problems. At the very least, a good CRM should have:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Client Database </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer Support Interface </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automated Analytics </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CRM also stores a complete history of all communication with each customer, so your team always knows what’s been discussed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without this, information can be scattered across emails or different messaging platforms, making it harder to find and potentially causing mistakes. This centralizes everything for easier and quicker access.</span></p>
<h3><strong>2. Sales</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales managers can use </span><b>CRM</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to track customer information, make the sales process easier, and create special offers for customers based on their needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This way the sales teams stay organized, save time, and make better decisions. The main <a href="https://www.neucenttechnologies.com/crm-features-for-scaling-businesses/"><em>features of a CRM</em></a> for sales include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account Management </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales Scheduling </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales Analytics </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automated Lead Management </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>3. Marketing </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CRM helps marketing teams work closely with sales teams, plan marketing campaigns, schedule events, and set goals. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also helps them understand customer profiles and check how well the business is doing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A marketing CRM makes it easier to manage campaigns, understand customers, and improve results. A marketing CRM usually includes features like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact management </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campaign management </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing automation </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analytics and Reporting </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4. CPQ &amp; Billing</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In industries like retail, having quick and automated quotes can help close deals faster. A CRM can automatically create quotes based on things like the number of items, discounts, or special features. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some CRMs can even handle billing automatically. If the CRM doesn&#8217;t meet all your needs, you can also create custom billing software to match your business as it grows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CRM helps businesses grow and unlock new opportunities that are missed with traditional systems. It is high time that you start developing your CRM platform for unique business propositions.</span></p>
<h2><span id="Table4" class="scroll_div">5 Key Steps for CRM Platform Development</span></h2>
<h3><strong>Step 1- Market Research</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any other app development, CRM platform development starts with in-depth market research.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It includes analyzing features and functionalities that help simplify the CRM process and improve user experience. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Step 3- Development </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This step will turn your design and goals into a functioning app. Once the planning is done, the development team starts building the custom CRM system based on the agreed plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They do this in steps, called </span><b>sprints</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where each step focuses on adding or improving specific features. This way, the project is broken into smaller, manageable parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the process, the team gets regular feedback from everyone involved (called </span><b>stakeholders</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">) to make sure the system is on track. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They check the progress, make any changes needed, and solve problems that come up. This helps improve the system as it&#8217;s being built.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Step 4- Testing </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the development process, the </span><b>QA (Quality Assurance)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team works with the project team to create a detailed test plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This plan explains what will be tested, how it will be tested, and what the system needs to do to be considered &#8220;good enough.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following this plan, the QA team tests the system carefully to find and fix any problems. All of this helps make sure the system works properly before it&#8217;s launched.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Step 5- Support and Maintenance</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CRM platform development process does not end with deployment. To keep it running and compete in the fastest-growing industry, you must keep it up-to-date, integrating the latest trends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consistent support will help businesses improve user experience, fix potential bugs, and add new features in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connect with the right CRM software development company, which promises to deliver the best possible CRM experience not only for businesses but for different teams across departments.</span></p>

<h3><strong>1. Artificial Intelligence and ML</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI and ML are transforming CRM systems. By 2030, the AI market is expected to be worth </span><a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5481228/explainable-ai-market-by-offering-by-deployment" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$21 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. AI will improve CRMs by moving beyond just text chatbots to voice-enabled ones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI will also help understand customer emotions, prioritize their requests, and even decide if a customer needs to talk to a human expert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Neucent Technologies, we stay updated with the latest </span><a href="https://www.neucenttechnologies.com/artificial-intelligence/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI developments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and offer custom AI solutions for our clients. We have experience in using AI and ML in many industries and can add these advanced features to your CRM system.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-53785 size-full" src="https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/Artificial-Intelligence-and-ML.jpg" alt="Artificial Intelligence and ML" width="1200" height="600" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#imagemodal" srcset="https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/Artificial-Intelligence-and-ML.jpg 1200w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/Artificial-Intelligence-and-ML-300x150.jpg 300w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/Artificial-Intelligence-and-ML-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/Artificial-Intelligence-and-ML-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<h3><strong>2. Mobile CRM Solutions</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market for mobile CRM software is expected to reach </span><a href="https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/mobile-crm-software-global-market-report" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$29.07 billion by 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this growing demand for CRM on the go, businesses are developing mobile CRM for real-time information and seamless accessibility from anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big trend in mobile CRM is adding offline capabilities. This means users can still access and update CRM data even without an internet connection, so they can keep working even in areas with weak or no internet.</span></p>
<h3><strong>3. Voice-activated CRM Platforms</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are more than </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/973815/worldwide-digital-voice-assistant-in-use/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8.4 billion voice assistants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This means the CRM industry will see big changes, too. Some popular CRM systems, like Salesforce Einstein, IBM Watson, and Microsoft Azure, already use AI to do more than just recognize voices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can help with tasks like analyzing data, making suggestions, and automating processes. These voice-powered CRM systems will keep getting better and smarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also build your own </span><a href="https://www.neucenttechnologies.com/ai-customer-service-chatbot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI customer support </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for your CRM platform. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing strong and reliable customer relationships is the key to success for every business. However, keeping up with all contacts and delivering personalized experiences to all is challenging without an automated process. CRM platforms can help businesses track and manage each customer while ensuring quick responses to better engage them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around </span><a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/crm-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">26% of SMBs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use CRM in their tech stack while 9% of small businesses are planning to integrate CRM this year. Not only this, </span><a href="https://www.sugarcrm.com/au/hd-cx/content/state-of-crm/?utm_source=sugarclub.sugarcrm.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60% of company leaders </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">use CRMs as a centralized communication hub to nurture potential leads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRM platforms help businesses to get real-time in-depth analysis of their captured leads and potential customers. This is why, choosing the right CRM platform or building one with the right features in place is crucial for lead management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This blog will help you understand the key CRM features to include or look for in 2025.</span></p>
<h2><span id="Table1" class="scroll_div">Essential CRM Functionality &amp; Features to Consider in 2025</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, top CRM platforms like Zoho, HubSpot, and more are known for their transparent and advanced features that help businesses reduce costs and improve efficiency. To build a CRM platform like Zoho, here are some key features to bet on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From small-scale to larger enterprises, these features are key to optimum results in less time.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53672" src="https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/Beige-and-Green-Simple-Modern-Online-Course-Learning-Desktop-Prototype-1.jpg" alt="15 Key CRM Features For Scaling Businesses in 2025 " width="1200" height="619" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#imagemodal" srcset="https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/Beige-and-Green-Simple-Modern-Online-Course-Learning-Desktop-Prototype-1.jpg 1200w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/Beige-and-Green-Simple-Modern-Online-Course-Learning-Desktop-Prototype-1-300x155.jpg 300w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/Beige-and-Green-Simple-Modern-Online-Course-Learning-Desktop-Prototype-1-1024x528.jpg 1024w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/01/Beige-and-Green-Simple-Modern-Online-Course-Learning-Desktop-Prototype-1-768x396.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<h3><strong>1. Contact Management </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than </span><a href="https://www.selecthub.com/customer-relationship-management/crm-software-buying-trends/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">45% of CRM usage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is for contact management and automation. Businesses can track of all their potential customers (leads), existing customers, and even people they want to do business with in the future. It stores important information about these people, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their name</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Address</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phone number</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media links</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Job title</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Company</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps cross-functional sales teams to access data instantly and track their history in one click. For example, Zoho CRM provides a multi-channel feature, so the sales team can connect with customers via email, live chat, phone, and social media, ensuring consistent support.</span></p>
<h3><strong>2. Customer Opportunity Management</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important features of CRM is to quantify the opportunity to convert leads. It is referred to as “Lead Scoring”. It helps the sales team to identify the customers who are most likely to convert. Using this information, the sales team can take appropriate actions like follow-up and providing personalized experience to guarantee conversion. This helps streamline sales/marketing teams, improve efficiency, and optimize your sales process.</span></p>
<h3><strong>3. Lead Management </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the motivations for using CRM is to scale sales. Lead management helps the sales team handle potential customers (called leads) and guides them through the journey to become paying customers. </span><a href="https://www.business.com/categories/crm-software/crm-market-usage-study/#our-data" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">51% of small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that adopt a CRM see an increase in lead conversion rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a CRM system, lead management helps businesses:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Capture leads</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Collect information about potential customers, like when they show interest (e.g., visiting your website).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Track their activities</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: See what the lead does, such as which pages they visit or what emails they open.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Qualify them</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Determine how likely the lead is to become a paying customer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Nurture them</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Stay in touch with leads, offering them the right information or support to help them make a purchase.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CRM system automatically captures lead details and tracks their actions, then assigns the lead to the right salesperson or team based on things like their location or interests. This helps make sure no lead is missed and that the right person follows up at the right time.</span></p>
<h3><strong>4. Reporting and Dashboard</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporting and dashboards are one of the key features of CRM. It helps users access an Ariel and a detailed view of their performance and track their progress. CRM displays statistics in highly visual and engaging graphs, charts, and customized reports for better understanding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an intuitive CRM dashboard, businesses can track their</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales activity (how much is being sold)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revenue (how much money is coming in)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New leads (potential customers)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales pipeline (the process of turning leads into customers)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KPIs to track important goals or numbers you track</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses can generate customized reports with different data from different sources. It helps them identify trends, analyze customer’s behavior, and measure progress. From tracking effective marketing campaigns to identifying the most engaging customer touchpoints for effective sales. </span></p>
<h3><strong>5. Mobile CRM</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To take the CRM capabilities on the go, Mobile <a href="https://www.neucenttechnologies.com/crm-trends-and-insights/">CRM is in the trends</a> today.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system organizes data by sales rep, so managers can compare performance. It also helps track how sales partners are doing. If there’s a problem, managers can use the data to quickly figure out what needs fixing and address it, making the whole team more effective.</span></p>
<h3><strong>7. Workflow Automation</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation is the key to reducing manual tasks and human errors. With workflow automation, the sales team can automate processes based on rules and logic. The task will be triggered once a specific condition is satisfied. </span><a href="https://www.sugarcrm.com/au/hd-cx/content/state-of-crm/?utm_source=sugarclub.sugarcrm.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 46% each</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, marketing automation &amp; email marketing are the top technologies users integrate with their CRM.</span></p>

There are different types of workflows, like managing deals, sending marketing emails, scoring leads, or asking for customer feedback. These automated workflows help salespeople by reducing the amount of manual work they have to do and ensuring things move forward without missing important steps.</span></p>
<h3><strong>8. Territory Management</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Territory management is a tool in CRM that helps assign specific sales agents to leads or customers based on things like location, industry, or the size of the account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if a salesperson specializes in healthcare, they’ll focus on leads in that industry, so they can know all the details, like regulations around patient privacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can set different ways to divide territories in your CRM, like by region, customer size, or industry. Sometimes, you can even combine factors, such as giving one agent the responsibility for both the retail industry and a specific location. This helps agents focus on what they know best and work more efficiently.</span></p>
<h3><strong>9. Email Marketing </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having seamless email marketing features within your CRM is a plus for a busy sales team. It helps the sales team to instantly send customized email campaigns to different custom segments for better reach.

It includes ready-made email templates, automatic sending, and tools to track how well your emails are doing.

<h3><strong>10. Sales Forecasting </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a business can predict their sales, it is a plus point for them. A sales forecast feature helps businesses predict when they will likely make a sale and how much money it will bring in. Modern CRM systems use smart technology, like artificial intelligence (AI), to make these predictions. They look at things like how good a lead is and how much money the sale might be worth to help estimate when the sale will happen.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sugarcrm.com/au/hd-cx/content/state-of-crm/?utm_source=sugarclub.sugarcrm.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80% of businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will start leveraging AI to improve sales forecasting processes and turn CRM data into insights for better customer experiences.</span></p>
<h3><strong>11. Document Management </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CRM document management feature helps you store, organize, and share documents like contracts, proposals, and other important files. Everyone in your team can access these documents from one central place within the CRM, without needing to leave the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also control who can view or edit each document. This makes it easier to find and share files quickly, improving response times and helping your team work more efficiently without needing to manually scan or send documents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every business has its own way of working and managing different approaches for lead management. Customization helps businesses to choose features that help them achieve their goals in less time. The most important things you can change include how you manage your sales process, how you score leads, what kinds of opportunities you track, and what contact information you save. Many CRMs let you add or change features so it works best for your needs. You can also turn on or off certain tools, like sales or marketing features, depending on what your business requires.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you offer marketing services or resell solutions to other businesses, you might want to look into &#8220;</span><a href="https://www.neucenttechnologies.com/crm-software-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">white label&#8221; CRMs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which are highly customizable and can be tailored to your specific customers&#8217; needs. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating the right tool with your CRM platform helps you extend your capabilities and functionalities. This helps your CRM do even more things by filling in any missing features. </span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media management</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>14. Cross-platform Compatibility </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It means your CRM can work on different devices and operating systems, like Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. This is important because businesses use a mix of devices, and you want your CRM to work smoothly on all of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For sales teams who work remotely or in the field, having mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones is key. These apps let users access important CRM features on the go, like updating customer info, moving deals through the sales process, and communicating with leads or customers directly from their phones.</span></p>
<h3><strong>15. Artificial Intelligence</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a feature, AI is a leading trend in CRM. AI has not only boosted the efficiency of the sales team but also reduced their work and time to respond to customers by <a href="https://nucleusresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/x76-The-expected-impact-of-generative-AI-in-CRM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">1</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">0% to 30%.</span></p>

<h2><strong><span id="Table2" class="scroll_div">2. Hyper-Personalization in CRM for Better Customer Engagement</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to better customer engagement is hyper-personalisation. It helps businesses create customized experiences that boost customer satisfaction and loyalty. In fact, 69% of marketing leaders say AI improves personalization. Businesses using AI in their CRM systems have experienced an increase in customer satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI helps companies like Amazon recommend products based on what customers have browsed or bought before, which increases sales. Even in industries like elderly care, personalized campaigns have led to a </span><a href="https://www.researchpublish.com/upload/book/Personalization%20and%20Customer%20Relationship-18072024-4.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">65% improvement in lead conversion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a 60% rise in customer satisfaction.</span></p>

<h2><strong><span id="Table4" class="scroll_div">4. The Rise of Social CRM</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media platforms are common among users. This is why, </span><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/uk/resources/articles/state-of-service-inside-customer-service-trends/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">82% of businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have a social media presence to connect with potential customers. Social CRM is one of the rising CRM trends that helps unlock more opportunities, and improve visibility, and collaboration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social CRM helps businesses have a unified view of all customers in a single place, bridging the gap between these platforms and business operations. Integrating social media into CRM turns social media data into valuable insights. For instance, if a customer tweets a complaint, the CRM system can flag it for the right team to handle. This ensures a quick, coordinated response, improving the overall customer experience.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span id="Table5" class="scroll_div">5. Low-code/No-code CRM for Innovation Without Complexities</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the changing business landscape, low-code/no-code solutions are rising.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike traditional CRM systems, LC/NC platforms eliminate these bottlenecks, empowering business users to create and modify workflows independently. This leads to faster, better customer service, quicker product launches, and more flexibility. For example, marketing teams can create custom CRM workflows without waiting for IT, making campaigns more effective. In the future, LC/NC tools will help businesses stay agile, meet customer needs, and improve their CRM systems.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span id="Table6" class="scroll_div">6. Mobile CRM</span></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://nucleusresearch.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study found that 65% of sales </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">reps with mobile CRM meet their sales quotas. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2027, </span><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5196163#:~:text=By%202027%2C%2090%25%20of%20new%20CRM%20marketing%20software%20spend%20will%20be%20for%20cloud%2Dbased%20deployments%2C%20up%20from%2086%25%20in%202022."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gartner says 90%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of CRM marketing software will be cloud-based, making it easier to use on mobile devices and sync data across all devices.</span></li>

<h2><strong><span id="Table7" class="scroll_div">7. Data Security </span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security is very important for CRM systems, especially for industries like healthcare that handle sensitive data. Businesses need CRM software that follows rules and regulations, like HIPAA, to protect customer information. Data shared between the cloud and customer devices is kept safe with encryption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The &#8220;zero-trust&#8221; security model, which checks every access request, will soon be the standard for CRM systems. This means no one can enter the system without verification. A good CRM system focuses on privacy by only collecting the necessary data for the customer’s journey and keeping it safe with encryption.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span id="Table8" class="scroll_div">8. CRM Automation for Better Lead Nurture </span></strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This roadmap is a general approach that any Python developer can choose for web app development in 2025. Consult a Python development company for smooth web app development.</span></p>
<h2><span id="Table6" class="scroll_div">Best Practices for Python Web Development</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some simple rules to follow when working with Python for web development:</span></p>
<p><b>1- Use a Web Framework</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Frameworks like </span><b>Django</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>Flask</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><b>Pyramid</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provide ready-made tools to help build websites. They make your coding easier and more organized.</span></p>
<p><b>2- Follow the MVC Pattern</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This means separating your app into three parts:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Model</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Where data is stored.</span></li>
<li><b>View</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: What the user sees.</span></li>
<li><b>Controller</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Manages how data and views interact. This makes your code cleaner and easier to manage.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>3- Use Virtual Environments</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Virtual environments keep your project’s packages separate from the rest of your system. This avoids conflicts and keeps your project organized.</span></p>
<p><b>4- Use ORM for Databases</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: An </span><b>ORM</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (like </span><b>SQLAlchemy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">) helps you interact with databases using Python, instead of writing complex database commands. This makes database work simpler and safer.</span></p>
<p><b>5- Write Unit Tests</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Testing your code helps find and fix problems early. Use tools like </span><b>unittest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><b>pytest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to automatically test your app and make sure everything works properly.</span></p>
<p><b>6- Handle Security in Web Development: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web apps can be attacked in many ways, so it&#8217;s important to follow security practices to keep your users safe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following these steps helps keep your code clean, organized, and easier to maintain.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Faster time-to-market-</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Next.js does not require custom configurations and backend infrastructure that speeds up the development process, which is critical for businesses aiming to launch quickly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Hybrid Architecture:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Next.js offers the flexibility to use SSR, SSG, or a mix of both. Businesses can choose the rendering strategy that fits their project’s needs. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Data-Driven Decisions:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Next.js integrates seamlessly with Vercel Analytics, allowing businesses to get real-time insights into page performance, load times, and user interactions. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disadvantages of Next.js</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Next.js supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR), but it might not be as flexible as other frameworks like Remix, which is built specifically for SSR.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next.js has a wide array of built-in features that make the code larger compared to other frameworks. This can slow down the initial page load, especially for users with slower internet connections.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SSR in Next.js can require a lot of server resources, especially for pages with lots of data or high traffic. This means you might need to optimize how data is fetched or upgrade your server to keep the performance smooth.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with these potential challenges, Next.js is still a popular choice for many companies building their applications. Let&#8217;s look at some of those companies.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53559" src="https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/12/1-5-scaled.jpg" alt="top companies using next.js" width="2560" height="1076" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#imagemodal" srcset="https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/12/1-5-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/12/1-5-300x126.jpg 300w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/12/1-5-1024x430.jpg 1024w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/12/1-5-768x323.jpg 768w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/12/1-5-1536x646.jpg 1536w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/12/1-5-2048x861.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<h2><span id="Table2" class="scroll_div">Remix Overview</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#2-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.6% developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prefer Remix. However, the number is very small compared to Next.js, it is still popular due to its modern and opinionated approach to web development. Things to know about Remix-</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It follows a &#8220;Fullstack React&#8221; approach that improves the developer’s experience through features like server-side rendering, data loading, and routing.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">built-in server and client-side hydration mechanisms to ensure fast initial page loads and smooth transitions while minimizing unnecessary reloads. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Also, read- </i></b><a href="https://www.neucenttechnologies.com/remix-the-next-gen-web-framework-for-faster-websites/"><b><i>Remix: The Next-Gen React Framework For Faster Websites</i></b></a></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Features of Remix</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Runs on the Web Fetch API</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Remix uses the Web Fetch API for its server, which makes it flexible. Unlike many frameworks that rely only on Node.js, Remix can run on various platforms like Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Workers, and Deno Deploy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>SSR as Default</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Remix focuses on Server-Side Rendering by default. This helps improve performance and boosts SEO and user experience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Automatic Code Splitting</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Remix speeds up initial loading by only loading what&#8217;s needed for the current page, avoiding delays.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Easy Routing Setup</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Setting up routes in Remix is simple and intuitive, making the development process smoother.</span></li>

</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advantages of Remix</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Nested Routing and Layouts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Remix allows developers to create more organized, reusable code for complex navigation by nesting routes inside layouts, which makes the app easier to manage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Loaders and Actions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These tools make it easy to fetch and update data without extra complexity. Loaders bring in data before the page loads, and Actions help with things like form submissions or updates.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Developer-Friendly</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Remix’s simple setup and clear structure make it easy for developers to build apps quickly, without unnecessary configuration.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Better Data Security</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Remix ensures that sensitive data stays on the server, preventing it from being exposed in the browser, which helps protect users’ privacy and security.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disadvantages of Remix</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Smaller Community</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Since Remix has fewer users, you might find fewer tutorials, libraries, or community help compared to a more popular framework like Next.js.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Client-Side Navigation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Remix is great for server-side rendering, but if your app needs complex client-side interactions (like dynamic content updates without reloading), Remix might not be as flexible as some other frameworks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Server-Side Focus</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Remix is built to run most operations on the server, which can be challenging if your app needs a lot of client-side logic, such as real-time features or live updates in the browser.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Table3" class="scroll_div">Key Differences: Remix vs. Next.js</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remix is as fast as Next.js for serving static content, ensuring a smooth user experience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remix is faster than Next.js at serving dynamic content, avoiding slow loading indicators.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remix performs better on slow networks, loading faster on a 3G connection than Next.js.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remix automatically handles errors, interruptions, and race conditions, while Next.js does not.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next.js encourages client-side JavaScript for dynamic content, whereas Remix doesn’t rely as much on it.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Table4" class="scroll_div">Detailed Comparision- NextJS vs Remix</span></h2>
<h3><strong>1. NextJS vs Remix- Layout and Routing </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When building web apps, many pages share the same structure, like sidebars or tabs. In the past, it was tricky to manage these shared layouts across different pages, but modern frameworks like </span><b>Remix</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>Next.js 13</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make it much easier.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Remix</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is simpler and more intuitive. You can tell which layout belongs to which URL just by looking at the file names and structure. Here is the file structure.</span></li>
</ul>
<pre>app/
routes/
_base.tsx
_base._index.tsx --&gt; /
_base.$username.tsx
_base.$username._index.tsx --&gt; /{username}
_base.$username.replies.tsx --&gt; /{username}/replies
_base.$username.likes.tsx --&gt; /{username}/likes
_base.status.$id.tsx --&gt; /status/{id}
_auth.tsx
_auth.signin.tsx --&gt; /signin
_auth.signup.tsx --&gt; /signup

</pre>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Next.js</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is more flexible and powerful but can look more complicated. It allows you to add extra features like loading states or error pages for each section of your app, which Remix doesn’t focus on as much. Here is the file structure.</span></li>
</ul>
<pre>app/
(base)/
[username]/
likes/
page.tsx --&gt; /{username}/likes
replies/
page.tsx --&gt; /{username}/replies
layout.tsx
page.tsx --&gt; /{username}
status/[id]/
page.tsx --&gt; /status/{id}
layout.tsx
page.tsx --&gt; /
(auth)
signin/
page.tsx --&gt; /signin
signup/
page.tsx --&gt; /signup

</pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both frameworks are great for building modern web apps with shared layouts, but Remix is a bit simpler, while Next.js gives you more control.</span></p>
<h3><strong>2. Data Fetching: NextJS vs Remix</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When building modern web apps, </span><b>data fetching</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is crucial because apps need to load data before they can display the page correctly. In the past, React apps would load an empty page first, and then fetch the data, which made things slow. Today, frameworks like </span><b>Remix</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>Next.js 13</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help by fetching data in more efficient ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><b>Remix</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, data fetching is done using </span><b>loaders</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When a page is requested, the loader fetches the data for that page. The key benefit of Remix is that it can fetch data for </span><b>multiple parts of the page at the same time (in parallel)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which speeds things up. For example, if a page has a sidebar and a main content section, Remix fetches the data for both parts simultaneously, rather than one after the other. Loaders can be used not just when the page first loads, but also when navigating between pages. This makes the app feel fast because it doesn’t need to wait for data every time the user clicks around.</span></p>

<p><b>Next.js 13</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses a new feature called </span><b>React Server Components</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (RSCs) for data fetching. RSCs are special components that run only on the server and fetch data directly there. They are not &#8220;hydrated&#8221; or rendered on the client side, meaning the browser doesn’t need to download extra JavaScript for them, which reduces the size of the app and improves performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With RSCs, data can be fetched directly inside components where it is needed. This approach is more flexible because it allows developers to fetch data exactly where it is needed in the component tree, rather than only in specific route files. However, React Server Components do have some limitations. Since they run on the server, they can&#8217;t include interactive features like buttons or forms directly. </span></p>

<h3><strong>3. Streaming- Remix vs. Next.js</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><b>Remix</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, streaming works through something called &#8220;loaders.&#8221; A loader fetches data for a specific part of the page (like tweets or user details) and you can tell Remix to </span><b>defer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> certain data fetching. This means it doesn’t block the page from loading; it starts by showing a loading state (like a spinner) and then replaces it with actual data once it&#8217;s ready. For example, if you are loading a list of tweets, Remix can start displaying the page while it still loads the tweets in the background. The page only updates when the tweets are ready.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><b>Next.js 13</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, streaming is also integrated but is simpler to implement. You can define a </span><b>loading.tsx</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> file for each route (part of your app), which automatically shows a loading state whenever data is being fetched. This works well for different parts of the page, like headers, sidebars, or content sections. Next.js uses </span><b>Suspense</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a React feature, to wrap these sections and show loading indicators while data is being fetched. If part of the page (like a tweet feed) needs data, it can display a spinner until the content is ready, without blocking other interactive parts of the page (like the ability to post a new tweet).</span></p>

<h3><strong>4. Data Mutations- NextJS vs Remix</strong></h3>
<p><b>Data mutations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> refer to actions that change or update data on the server, like creating, updating, or deleting records. In many web applications, developers handle this by sending API requests and updating the UI. However, </span><b>Remix</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>Next.js</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> both have built-in features to make data mutations easier and more integrated into their frameworks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><b>Remix</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, data mutations are handled using something called </span><b>actions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Whenever a user interacts with a form (like submitting a new post or clicking a &#8220;like&#8221; button), Remix triggers the action associated with that form. The key part of Remix&#8217;s approach is that it automatically </span><b>refetches the data</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and updates the page after an action is performed, keeping the UI in sync with the server. This is called a </span><b>full-stack data flow</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which means that the server handles both data fetching and mutations, and the page gets updated accordingly. Remix also encourages using HTML forms for interactions, making it simpler to handle common actions like user sign-ins or posting comments without writing much JavaScript.</span></p>
<p><b>Next.js</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> introduced server actions to simplify mutations, but they are still in an experimental phase. It offers flexibility by allowing server functions to be used anywhere in the app, but lacks the automatic UI updates and revalidation that Remix provides. Server actions allow developers to define functions that run on the server and can be triggered directly from React components—without needing separate API routes.</span></p>
<h3><strong>5. Infinite Loading</strong></h3>
<p><b>Infinite Loading</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a pattern where content loads as you scroll down a page, such as loading more tweets on Twitter. This requires efficient management of both server-side and client-side behavior to load and display new content without reloading the page.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Remix, </span><b>infinite loading</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is managed through </span><b>resource routes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These are special routes that don’t directly render any UI but are used to fetch data. The first page of content (e.g., tweets) is loaded from the server, and for the following pages, Remix uses </span><b>loaders</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>fetchers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get new data as the user scrolls. However, Remix requires you to manage the state for things like tweet likes or retweets manually, often using </span><b>useReducer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This gives you flexibility but means you have to write more custom code for things like fetching data and managing state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next.js, on the other hand, simplifies things with </span><b>server actions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>server components</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here, data fetching is easier because you can handle it directly inside the component. The first set of data is streamed from the server, and subsequent pages are loaded using </span><b>server actions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which are functions that run on the server and can be triggered by the client. This makes it easier to implement infinite scrolling without needing to create separate API routes or complex fetchers. In Next.js, the framework helps you manage both the data fetching and state in a more integrated way, making it faster to implement.</span></p>
<h3><strong>6. Error Handling in Remix vs. Next.js</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><b>Remix</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can use an </span><b>ErrorBoundary</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in each route segment. This special component helps catch errors, both on the server and in the browser. For example, if a page can’t be found (a 404 error), you can throw a </span><b>Response</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the loader (the function that fetches data for the page), and Remix will show the appropriate error page. Remix allows you to handle these errors in a very </span><b>customizable way</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at each route level, so you can show different error states for different parts of your app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><b>Next.js</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, error handling is also done with specific files in each route. If something goes wrong, you can create an </span><b>error.tsx</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> file for the route to handle errors. This file wraps the route in an </span><b>ErrorBoundary</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to catch errors in that specific segment. For 404 errors, Next.js uses a special </span><b>not-found.tsx</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> file in each route segment. You can return a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">notFound()</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> function from your server-side code to trigger this 404 page whenever the route doesn&#8217;t match or data can&#8217;t be found.</span></p>
<h2><span id="Table5" class="scroll_div">When to Use Remix?</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>SEO-Friendly and Fast Websites:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Remix is great for building websites and apps that need to perform well in search engines (SEO) and load quickly. Its focus on </span><b>server-side rendering</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (SSR) and efficient delivery of content makes it perfect for apps with complex layouts and dynamic data that need to be search-engine friendly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Works Well in Unreliable Networks:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Remix is built to handle situations where the network might be slow or unreliable. It has features like </span><b>progressive enhancement</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>offline support</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allowing users to interact with the app even when they&#8217;re not connected to the internet. This makes it a good choice for apps that need to work smoothly even in poor network conditions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Complex User Interactions and Data:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Remix shines in apps that require complex user interactions, like managing forms or handling data updates. It has a special approach to handling </span><b>forms</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>data mutations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (like submitting and updating data on the server) that makes it easier to build these features.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Frequent Data Updates:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If your app requires frequent data updates (e.g., real-time data or constant form submissions), Remix is a strong choice. Its </span><b>Action functions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make it simpler to handle complex data updates and user interactions on the server, which helps keep your app running smoothly.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Table6" class="scroll_div">When to Use Next.js?</span></h2>
<p><b>Next.js</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great choice in the following situations:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Flexible Rendering Options:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If your project needs different ways to load content, Next.js is perfect. It allows you to mix different rendering methods, like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), or client-side rendering, depending on what each page needs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Complex Features or Advanced Functionality:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you&#8217;re building something with advanced features, Next.js is a great choice. It&#8217;s popular among developers, so you&#8217;ll have lots of support, tools, and resources available to help you build your app faster and easier.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Scalability and Content-Rich Websites:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If your app needs to handle a lot of content (like blogs, news sites, or anything with a lot of pages), Next.js is built to scale well. It optimizes large websites for better performance and smooth navigation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Global Audience (Multi-language Support):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you need to make your website available in different languages, Next.js has built-in tools for </span><b>internationalization</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This makes it easier to create apps that can be localized for different regions and languages, which is great for global businesses.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s understand- To Build an AI-Powered Content Moderation Engine On AWS?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, if you&#8217;re running a website or app that lets people share their feedback and any type of content—like reviews, posts, or messages. Dealing with user-generated content can create problems like spam, fake news, or people trying to break the rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Spammers hide links to products inside fake reviews to trick people.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Memes with false information spread quickly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Some users find ways to bend the rules without breaking them.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To handle these issues, businesses need smart systems that automatically detect bad content. You can leverage powerful AI tools from companies like AWS to build automated moderation systems to check every post or comment without manual effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this post, we&#8217;ll explain how AI-powered content moderation works and how you can set it up for your platform using AWS technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let’s first understand what is an automated content moderation system.</span></p>
<h2><span id="Table1" class="scroll_div">What is an Automated Content Moderation System?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An automated content moderation system automatically checks and filters the content people post online, such as reviews, comments, or images. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It uses algorithms, machine learning, and AI to do this. The goal is to keep the online space safe, respectful, and fun for users without needing people to check everything manually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Platforms like Meta, Facebook, and X are using such platforms to make the space safe for their users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are three main types of ACM:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Service-based</b><span style="font-weight: 400">: This involves third-party companies or people who provide moderation services to help manage online content.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Software-based</b><span style="font-weight: 400">: This is the technology (like AI tools) businesses can use to do the moderation themselves.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Platform-based</b><span style="font-weight: 400">: Some platforms (like social media websites) build their own moderation systems.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These systems save time and effort by reducing the need for humans to check every post, making it easier to manage different types of online content in areas like communication, e-commerce, media, and government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With technologies like AI, businesses can automate the process to reduce time and effort, resulting in safer interactions. AI has improved the working of these content moderation systems. Let us understand how it helps businesses. </span></p>
<h2><span id="Table2" class="scroll_div">How can AI Help Build Content Moderation Engines?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">AI-powered moderation engines are tools that help manage the huge amount of content people share online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These systems can quickly look through a lot of data, recognize new types of harmful content (like spam or hate speech), and work with human moderators to keep things safe and clean. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They make the process faster and more consistent, helping to create a healthier online space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It helps businesses-</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">It helps businesses protect users from disturbing content</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To build your own AI-powered content moderation system, understand how it works.</span></p>
<h2><span id="Table3" class="scroll_div">How Does an AI-Powered Content Moderation System Work?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An AI-driven content moderation engine processes all the comments, reviews, and feedback through a structured workflow. It all depends on the rule that you set to process all content on social platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It helps businesses to adhere community guidelines without checking everything personally. While AI does the hard work, you can focus on building a stronger community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here is the breakdown of how the engine works.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Detection</b><span style="font-weight: 400">: The system checks the content using AI to find any problems, such as offensive language, spam, or hate speech.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Evaluation</b><span style="font-weight: 400">: Once potential issues are detected, the system looks at the context and seriousness of the problem to decide if it really breaks the rules. Sometimes, a human checks it too.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Decision</b><span style="font-weight: 400">: Based on this evaluation, the AI decides what to do. It might let the content be posted, flag it for review, or block it if it’s against the rules.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Execution</b><span style="font-weight: 400">: The system immediately carries out the decision. If the content is fine, it gets published. If it’s not, it’s either rejected or sent to a person to review further.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Logging</b><span style="font-weight: 400">: The system keeps a record of every decision it makes, so there’s a clear history of what happened. This helps improve the moderation process and ensures everything is fair.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This whole process works with AI, machine learning, and cloud services, which makes it easier for businesses to set up and use powerful tools to manage content automatically. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, which cloud services you should choose remains the constant question of businesses. However, I personally recommend choosing AWS due to its ease and reliable AI services and tools for better compatibility. </span></p>
<h2><span id="Table4" class="scroll_div">Key Steps to build an AI-powered content moderation engine using AWS</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53542" src="https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/12/2-4.jpg" alt="How Does an AI-Powered Content Moderation System Work?" width="2400" height="1600" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#imagemodal" srcset="https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/12/2-4.jpg 2400w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/12/2-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/12/2-4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/12/2-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/12/2-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://d3puhl2t51lebl.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/12/2-4-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Step 1- Data Collection </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For an AI content moderation system to work, you need to store the content somewhere. This step involves collecting data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You collect user-generated content from your platform, such as text, comments, images, and videos, which might include both acceptable content and content that violates your rules (like hate speech or explicit material). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can use cloud services like Amazon S3 to store and organize the data by content type. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Organizing data helps AI to learn from scenarios while security controls ensure that only authorized people can access the data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">AWS implements industry-leading security measures for more controlled access to data.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Step 2- Data Processing </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cleaning is the first step after collecting data. It means fixing mistakes, getting rid of unnecessary or confusing information (called &#8220;noise&#8221;), and making sure everything follows the same format. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the data comes in different forms (like text, images, or videos), each type needs a different cleaning method to get it ready for the next steps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You label each piece of content to show if it follows the rules or breaks them using </span><b>Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, you split the labeled data into three parts: one for training the AI, one for checking its progress, and one for testing it later.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Step 3- Model building and training</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you choose AWS to build an AI-powered content moderation system. All the content classification and filtering are done using advanced ML algorithms. These models help in spotting bad language or hate speech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can use existing AI models and train them using these two approaches.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Custom Model Training</b><span style="font-weight: 400">: You can use </span><b>Amazon SageMaker</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to train your own models on your specific content. It helps you add special rules based on the data. Then you can use </span><b>SageMaker Ground Truth</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to label this data like &#8220;safe,&#8221; &#8220;violent,&#8221; &#8220;adult,&#8221; or &#8220;hate speech.&#8221;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Fine-Tuning Existing Models</b><span style="font-weight: 400">: If you don’t have enough data, you can use pre-trained models from </span><b>Amazon Bedrock</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. These models are already built, and you can adjust them to fit your needs for content moderation. It’s faster and works well when you have a smaller dataset.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To make the moderation even better, you can add extra tools like </span><b>Amazon Comprehend</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to analyze text for bad language and sentiment, and </span><b>Amazon Rekognition</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to analyze images and videos for inappropriate content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The training process is ongoing, so you will keep improving the model to make it more accurate and reduce mistakes, like wrongly blocking good content or letting bad content through.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Step 4- Testing and Evaluating Models</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once your model is trained, it’s time to test how well it works in real situations. Testing helps you see how the model performs and where it might need improvement to keep your platform safe and trustworthy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can use the &#8220;test set&#8221; of data to check its performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When testing, you should focus on these key points:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">How correct are the model’s predictions overall?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Out of all the content the model flagged as bad, how much of it was bad?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Out of all the bad content, how much did the model correctly find?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">How fast does the model make its predictions?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Use </span><b>Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to track the model’s performance over time. If the results are not as expected, you can adjust the model settings, or start again from collecting correct data to re-train the model.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Step 5- Moderation Pipeline Development</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After training your models, the next step is to build a system that can check content in real-time. This system will automatically decide if content is okay or needs to be flagged.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">First, you need a </span><b>content ingestion</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> system to collect the incoming content (like text, images, or videos). You can use services like </span><b>Amazon Kinesis</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to manage lots of content quickly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the content goes through </span><b>pre-processing</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, where it’s prepared for the model (like breaking text into smaller parts or resizing images).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Next, the content is passed through your </span><b>model</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to decide if it’s good or violates rules. You can use </span><b>Amazon SageMaker</b><span style="font-weight: 400">to to make this process fast and handle more content at once.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">After the model makes its decision, you apply </span><b>post-processing</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. This step turns the model’s results into actions, like removing harmful content or sending it for human review.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, to manage everything, you use </span><b>AWS Step Functions</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. This organizes the whole process, making sure everything runs smoothly and fixes any problems that come up.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Step 6- Implement Human Review System</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">AI is great at handling most content moderation, but it still needs human help for tricky situations or mistakes. To add human review, create an easy-to-use interface for moderators to check flagged content, using </span><b>AWS Amplify</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, set up a process for handling difficult cases, including a way to escalate tough situations to higher-level reviewers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, use </span><b>Amazon Augmented AI (A2I)</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to combine human checks with the AI system smoothly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This system allows humans to review AI’s decisions when needed, and their feedback helps improve the AI model, making it more accurate over time.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Step 7- Deployment </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The final step is to connect your moderation system to your platform, launch it, and keep it running smoothly. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">First, use </span><b>Amazon API Gateway</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to create and manage the APIs to streamline communication with the moderation system. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, use tools like </span><b>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> or </span><b>Amazon ECS</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> for deployment to make it easy to scale and manage.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then use </span><b>Amazon CloudWatch</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to monitor accuracy, response times, and performance. You can also set up alerts to send notifications in case of anomalies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After deploying the moderation system, keep reviewing moderation decisions and user feedback to find areas for improvement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Regularly update your training data with new examples for better results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you follow these steps, you can build a solid AI-powered content moderation engine, but implementing such a system in the real world presents challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Consulting with AI and AWS experts will help you overcome such challenges. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let’s explore the challenges that you must consider. </span></p>
<h2><span id="Table5" class="scroll_div">Expert Solutions to AI Content Moderation Challenges </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here are some challenges-</span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Nuanced Data</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">AI might not work efficiently with tricky content like sarcasm, cultural references, or things that depend on context, which might cause mistakes. To solve this challenge, you can</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Choose a </span><b>hybrid approach </b><span style="font-weight: 400">that combines AI with human efforts, where AI handles most of the moderation but uses human moderators for difficult cases. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Use </span><b>Amazon Augmented AI (A2I)</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to make it easy for humans to review AI’s decisions when needed. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2. Staying up-to-date with Changing standards</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Online rules and what’s considered acceptable change quickly. What’s okay today might not be tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The solution is to </span><b>keep your system learning</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Regularly retrain your AI models using new data with </span><b>Amazon SageMaker</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, create a feedback system where human moderators can spot new trends or changes in what’s acceptable, helping the AI stay current and aware of shifting norms.</span></p>
<h3><strong>3. Handling Multimodal Content</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Users share all sorts of content, like text, images, videos, and audio, making it tricky to moderate everything at once.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Use </span><b>Amazon Rekognition to </b><span style="font-weight: 400">analyze images and videos. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Use </span><b>Amazon Transcribe</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to turn audio into text, and </span><b>Amazon Comprehend</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to analyze text. Combine these tools to create a strong moderation system to handle all types of content.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4. Scale while being accurate</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You need to moderate a huge amount of content quickly and accurately. AI can help automate this, but the models need to be fast and able to handle lots of content at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The solution is to use </span><b>Amazon SageMaker</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to improve your models for both accuracy and speed. Set up a system where obvious cases are handled automatically, and more complicated ones are sent to human reviewers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With </span><b>AWS&#8217;s scalable infrastructure</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, you can also manage large amounts of content during busy times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Platforms like </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/anishasircar/2024/10/18/xs-latest-content-findings-reveal-troubling-trends-in-ai-moderation/"><span style="font-weight: 400">X and Meta also struggle with a </span><b>lack of transparency</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> i</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">n how their AI systems work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This makes it difficult for users or regulators to understand why certain content was flagged or allowed to stay online. Without clear guidelines, users may feel that moderation is inconsistent or unfair.</span></p>
